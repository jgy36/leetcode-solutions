## Problem Solving Approach

Each solution is designed to solve a specific problem efficiently using the appropriate data structures and algorithms. For each problem, I have made an effort to:
- Optimize for time and space complexity.
- Provide a clear explanation of the approach used.
- Offer alternative solutions when applicable.

## Solution Organization

The solutions are organized by difficulty and programming language. Here is how the repository is structured:
- **Easy**: Problems that are considered relatively simple and straightforward.
- **Medium**: Problems that require deeper thinking and a good understanding of algorithms.
- **Hard**: Advanced problems involving more complex algorithms and data structures.

Each file contains the solution, and the code is annotated with comments for clarity.

## Languages Used

The solutions in this repository are implemented in the following languages:
- Python
- JavaScript
- Java
- C++
- C
